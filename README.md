# Arrow-X
A basic recon tool which combines assetfinder, subfinder, jq, httprobe, nmap, whatweb, and wafw00f.

1) This tool can only be used on any type of Linux as it requires the above Linux tools to work. (Kali Linux is recommended)

2) The shell script can be run by itself from the terminal without needing the GUI code.

3) But if you intend to use the GUI then you need the shell script to be in the same folder as that of the GUI code for it to work.
